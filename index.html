        Here's a little on me:
    </h2>

    <p>
        I live in Nanaimo, BC, and I <em><strong>love</strong></em> playing guitar and video games. I mainly only listen
        to metal music (thus my love for the guitar),<br>
        which can sometimes make it hard to relate to other people's music tastes due to metal <em>not</em> being very
        popular anymore. <br>Another one of my hobbies is spending money. It's not a very good hobby, in fact, I'd say
        it's
        a bad hobby. I seem to like to spend my money on computer components and accessories
    </p>
    <p>Here's a list of 3 of my classes this semester:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Technologies</li>
        <li>Scripting for IT</li>
        <li>Intro To Sys Admin</li>
    </ul>
