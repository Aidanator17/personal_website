            Hi, I'm Aidan.

            Here's a little on me:

            <p>
                I live in Nanaimo, BC, and I <em><strong>love</strong></em> playing guitar and video games. I mainly
                only
                listen
                to metal music (thus my love for the guitar),
            </p>
            <p>
                which can sometimes make it hard to relate to other people's music tastes due to metal <em>not</em>
                being
                very
                popular anymore.
            </p>
            <p>Another one of my hobbies is spending money. It's not a very good hobby, in fact,
                I'd
                say
                it's
                a bad hobby. I seem to like to spend my money on computer components and accessories
